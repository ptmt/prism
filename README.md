# TLDR

It's like a TodoMVC sandbox but a bit more complex. And I love checkins, though it seems Foursquare doesn't anymore.

# Stack

- React.js + React-hot-loader + Webpack + Reflux for UI;
- Material Design (Material UI);
- Subset of ES6 for server and client (classes, lambdas);
- Facebook Flow + React types for type checking;
- Gulp for build pipeline;
- Leaflet + toner;
- Bluebird for Promises;


# Getting started
