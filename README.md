# TLDR

It's like a TodoMVC sandbox but a slightly more complex which operates with data in-memory only,
to decrease privacy issues. Current version is written in typed ES6 for React and Node.js.

# Privacy

There is no databases yet. All data obtained from third-party providers
stored in memory-only.

# Motivation

I love checkins, though it seems Foursquare doesn't anymore.

# Stack

- React.js + React-hot-loader + Webpack + Reflux for client-side;
- Material Design (Material UI);
- Subset of React ES6 for server and client (classes, lambdas);
- `connect` and `connect-rest` for API;
- Facebook Flow for type checking;
- Gulp for build pipeline;
- Leaflet + toner;
- Bluebird for Promises;
