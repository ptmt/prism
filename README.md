# TLDR

It's like TodoMVC sandbox but a bit more complex. And I love checkins, though it seems Foursquare doesn't anymore.

# Stack

- React.JS + Reflux for UI;
- Bootstrap + Material Design (Paper);
- Subset of ES6 for server and client (classes, lambdas);
- Facebook Flow + React types for type checking;
- Gulp, Browserify + Buffer + Watchify;
- Leaflet + toner;
- Bluebird for Promises;


# Getting started


```
npm install -g flow-bin
npm install
gulp test
gulp watch
```
