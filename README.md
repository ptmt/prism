# TLDR

Sandbox. And I love checkins, but it seems Foursquare doesn't anymore.

# Stack

- React.JS + Reflux for UI;
- Bootstrap + Material Design;
- Subset of ES6 for server and client (classes, lamdas);
- Facebook Flow + React types for type checking;
- Gulp, Browserify + Buffer + Watchify;
- Leaflet +
